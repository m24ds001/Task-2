# Task-2
Multi-Modal AI Chatbot
This project develops a multi-modal chatbot capable of processing and generating both text and image content. Unlike traditional chatbots, this application can understand visual inputs, seamlessly integrate them with text in conversations, and provide detailed image-based analysis. It's built on Google's Gemini AI models, which are designed from the ground up for multimodal capabilities.

1. Problem Statement
The challenge is to build a chatbot that can move beyond text-only interactions to understand the real world through visual data. The goal is to create a system that can accept text and images as input, process this combined information, and generate a relevant response. This allows for a more natural and powerful user experience, enabling tasks like visual question-answering, image-based problem-solving, and general image analysis.

2. Dataset
This project does not use a fixed, pre-trained dataset. Instead, the "dataset" is dynamic and user-provided.

Inputs: The chatbot's data consists of live, user-provided inputs, including:

Text messages from the user.

Image files uploaded by the user.

Gemini Models: The system leverages the vast training data of Google's Gemini models, which are trained on a massive scale of multimodal data, including images, videos, and text. This training allows the models to handle a wide range of tasks, from image classification to visual question-answering, without needing to be fine-tuned on specialized datasets.

3. Methodology
The chatbot's architecture is built on a direct interaction with the Google Gemini API, facilitated by the Gradio framework for the user interface.

Gradio Interface: A user-friendly Gradio interface is built with two main modes: a multi-modal chat and a dedicated image analysis tool. The interface provides separate inputs for text and images, allowing for flexible user interactions.

Multimodal Processing: The core logic is in the process_multimodal_input function, which checks for the presence of an image in the user's input.

If an image is present, the function routes the request to a vision-capable Gemini model (e.g., gemini-pro-vision, gemini-1.5-pro) to process both the image and any accompanying text.

If only text is present, it uses a text-only Gemini model to generate a response, while also incorporating a limited conversation history for context.

API Integration: The project uses the google-generativeai Python library to interact with the Gemini API. An API key is required from each user to run the models, ensuring the application can operate without a backend server.

Model Selection: The app (1).py code includes helper functions (get_available_model and get_available_vision_model) to automatically check for and use an available model, making the application robust to API changes and model availability.

4. Results
The project successfully demonstrates the power of a multi-modal AI chatbot.

Seamless Multimodal Interaction: The chatbot can seamlessly handle conversations that include both text and images. For example, a user can upload a photo of a plate of cookies and ask for the recipe, to which the model can respond with a written recipe.

Comprehensive Image Analysis: The dedicated image analysis tab proves the model's ability to "understand" and describe visual inputs in detail, including subjects, colors, composition, and even visible text.

Code-Free Agent Creation: The project demonstrates how to build a powerful AI application with a rich user interface using an intuitive API and framework, reducing the need for specialized machine learning expertise.

Robustness: The API key testing and automatic model selection mechanisms make the application reliable and user-friendly, providing clear feedback on its status and availability.
